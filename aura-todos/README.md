# TodoMVC based on Aura

Implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) application based on the
Aura framework.

## Installing

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (Only used for building the app, not needed
for deployment)

[grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) as a global module.
It's amazing so you should do it anyways.

    [sudo] npm install grunt-cli bower -g

then install grunt and its modules in the project's folder.

    cd aura-todos/
    npm install & bower install

## Running the app

### To run the app locally, run:

    grunt server
